Add the frozen noodles and simmer for 18 minutes (or according to package directions), until they are mostly tender (they'll cook a few more minutes in the next step). In a liquid measuring cup or blender, whisk or blend the milk and flour together until smooth (no lumps!). Whisk the mixture quickly into the soup and simmer for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the frozen peas and cooked chicken and heat through. Add additional salt and pepper to taste before serving. The soup will thicken as it sits (and if there are leftovers, they'll definitely thicken up even more in the refrigerator)."

Heat over medium heat until milk starts foaming around the edges. Do not boil. Remove from heat and mix in the Chambord. Let cool for about 10 minutes. Strain mixture to remove vanilla beans.In a large bowl, whip the egg yolks and sugar until pale yellow in color and slightly thicken. While stirring constantly, gradually add the hot cream mixture into the eggs mixture. Add the cream slowly to avoid cooking the eggs. Mix until combined.Pour equal amounts into 6 ramekins (6 ounces each). Transfer ramekins to baking pans (9-inch or bigger) and fill baking pans with hot water about halfway up the sides of ramekins.Bake custards until set but still jiggly in the center, about 35-40 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool on cooling rack. Cover with plastic rack and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight.When ready to serve, sprinkle about 1 tablespoon turbinado sugar over each ramekin. Using a torch, melt the sugar until golden brown. Or using an oven set to broil, broil for 30 seconds to a minute to melt the sugar. Be careful not to burn the sugar (like I did).Let cool until the sugar hardens."
